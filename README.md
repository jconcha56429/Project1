## Project 1 - Shelter Animal Outcomes
***
#### Members: Annika Pavlovich, Christopher Velasquez, Isha Kundra, Jacob Concha, Robin Christoffersen
***
Our project seeks to uncover patterns with adopted and euthanized animals.  We were also interested to see if the pandemic affected shelters and the animals within them.  We look at how long an animal stays in shelter.  Our focus was mainly on how each component affected each animalâ€™s future.
***
### Project questions:
1. Which animals/breeds are the most adopted? Statistical...
2. Is there an age, size, gender relationship based on adoption/availability?
2. Adoption rates over the years prior to 2020/2021.  Did Covid affect adoption rates?
3. Euthanization rates and reasons behind those cases? (Breeds/reason)
4. Time or residence for each animal type in shelter before their outcome?
